This meant that we need to iterate or loop over the list and pass each element into our set operation. Comprehensions allow us to iterate over a sequence and store the elements in a new data structure in a lot less code than manually writing a for loop and appending each element to the new data structure. The set comprehension notation programmatically is equivalent to the standard set notation in that it created an identical set operation. However, we can see each element in the standard set notation versus only logically seeing each element in the comprehension notation. Imagine having a list of thousands of numbers that you need to extract each unique element for. You wouldn't want to sit and manually go through and write down each element that you hadn't already seen. You wouldn't be able to pass a list directly into a set either as this would throw an error. You could manually write a for loop and at each iteration pass that specific element into the set, but this would take more lines of code. Thus you would want to use a set comprehension."

The answer is that while we used the same declaration name, each of these variables vary in scope. Specifically, the greeting variable inside of our greeting function is what is called a local variable. The greeting variable we created outside of our greeting function is called a global variable. Our local variable is named as such because it is only local or known by our function. Other object outside of our function are unaware of what this variable is.

The range function allows you to create a range of numbers from some starting point to some ending point. It also allows you to specify a step size or some amount in which to increment. The len function returns the length of whatever data structure you pass in. So in our example, we received the length of our list of names, of which corresponds to how many names we have and then passed that number into our range function. This means that we are stating to create a range of index positions in our list of names. Thus when we wrote the statement for name in..., name is referring to the index positions.
